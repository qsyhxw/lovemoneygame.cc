              Lovemoney game is officially available on Windows and macOS. Download the game files from the <a href="https://buwu3.itch.io/llllollll" class="underline hover:text-pink-600 dark:hover:text-pink-300 font-semibold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official itch.io page</a> created by developer Buwu. The game is also playable through unofficial browser embeds on fan sites, though these are not officially maintained.

              After downloading the ZIP file from itch.io, extract all files using WinRAR, 7-Zip, or your system's built-in extraction tool. Open the extracted game folder and locate the executable file (it will have the game's name and a small icon next to it). Double-click this file to launch the game. Windows users may see a security warning for unsigned applications, which is normal for independent games — simply click "More info" and then "Run anyway" to proceed.

            <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700 dark:text-white/80">
              Your objective is straightforward: earn $25,000 to pay for a life-saving medical operation. You meet Harvey at his stall, and he offers you a simple deal — click him to earn money, starting at $1 per click. The challenge isn't just reaching the dollar amount, but deciding how far you're willing to go to get there quickly. Every purchase you make from Harvey's shop increases your earnings but also affects your relationship with him and determines which ending you'll experience.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Clicking System</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-700 dark:text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
              The game uses a simple mouse-based clicking mechanic. Each click on Harvey earns you money, starting at $1 per click. This is your primary method of earning throughout the game. While the clicking may seem repetitive, the moral weight of each interaction and Harvey's changing reactions create an emotional layer that sets this apart from typical clicker games. The official itch.io page lists "Mouse" as the only input method, though some community reports suggest keyboard shortcuts like spacebar may work in browser versions — however, this is not officially confirmed by developer Buwu.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Shop & Upgrades</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-700 dark:text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
              As you accumulate money, you can purchase items from Harvey's shop to increase your earnings per click. The first available item is the Feather, which costs $100 and doubles your click value to $2 per interaction. This is confirmed across multiple community sources and represents the single most important early-game purchase. Additional items become available as you earn more money, with prices increasing significantly for later upgrades. Each purchase not only boosts your income but also changes Harvey's dialogue, facial expressions, and emotional state, creating moral consequences for efficiency-focused strategies.
            </p>
            <div class="mt-4 p-4 rounded-xl bg-blue-50/80 dark:bg-blue-900/10 border border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-800 text-sm">
              <p class="text-blue-900 dark:text-blue-200">
                <strong>💡 Community Strategy:</strong> One player guide recommends buying the Feather immediately once you reach $100, as it doubles your click efficiency and significantly speeds up your progress toward the $25,000 goal. Later items like Brush, Massager, and Lipstick are mentioned in community guides but their exact prices and effects have not been independently verified.

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Time to Complete</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-700 dark:text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
              The official itch.io page lists the average session as "a few minutes," but community reports suggest a more realistic completion time of 30-60 minutes for a focused playthrough, depending on your clicking speed and upgrade strategy. Some players report longer sessions of 3-5 hours if they explore dialogue options, experiment with different moral choices, or aim for specific endings. The significant time variance exists because the game doesn't have a fixed pace — your approach to Harvey's wellbeing versus speed determines how quickly you progress.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Multiple Endings</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-700 dark:text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
              Lovemoney features multiple endings based on your choices throughout the game. While some websites claim there are "14 endings," we have not found evidence to support this specific number from official sources or multiple independent players. What is confirmed is that the game has at least 2-4 distinct story paths, influenced primarily by which items you purchase and how you treat Harvey. One community source specifically mentions that "the last item" is the key decision that determines your ending, creating a final moral choice once you've accumulated enough money. For detailed ending information, see our <a href="/all-endings/" class="underline hover:text-pink-600 dark:hover:text-pink-300 font-semibold">Complete Endings Guide</a>.

              Buy the Feather First ($100)
            </h3>
            <p class="text-slate-700 dark:text-white/80 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              Your first 100 clicks at $1 each will feel slow, but resist the temptation to skip ahead. Once you purchase the Feather for $100, your click value doubles to $2, effectively cutting your remaining work in half. This makes it the highest-value upgrade in the game relative to its cost. Every subsequent item will be easier to save for once you have the Feather multiplier.

              Pay Attention to Harvey's Reactions
            </h3>
            <p class="text-slate-700 dark:text-white/80 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              Harvey's facial expressions and dialogue change based on which items you purchase. If you notice him becoming distressed or uncomfortable, you're moving into morally complex territory that may lead toward specific endings. Players who care about achieving a "good" ending should pace their purchases and give Harvey time to recover between interactions, rather than rushing to buy every available upgrade immediately.
            </p>

              Understand the Two Playstyle Paths
            </h3>
            <p class="text-slate-700 dark:text-white/80 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              Lovemoney presents a fundamental choice between speed and compassion. You can either push every moral boundary to reach $25,000 as quickly as possible, or take a slower, more ethical approach that preserves your relationship with Harvey. Neither path is objectively "correct" — the game is designed to make you consider what you value more: efficiency or empathy. Your first playthrough will likely follow your natural instincts, which makes subsequent playthroughs feel meaningfully different.
            </p>
          </div>

              The Final Decision Matters Most
            </h3>
            <p class="text-slate-700 dark:text-white/80 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              According to community sources, the ending you receive is heavily influenced by whether you purchase "the last item" in Harvey's shop. Once you're close to the $25,000 goal, you'll face a final moral choice that determines your conclusion. Consider saving your game before making this decision if you want to explore different outcomes without replaying the entire game — though note that manual save functionality has not been officially confirmed by the developer.

              Explore the UPDATE Version's Secrets
            </h3>
            <p class="text-slate-700 dark:text-white/80 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              The UPDATE version of the game contains additional mechanics and secret content not present in the OLD version. Players have discovered 12 hidden notes scattered throughout the game and a password-protected screen accessible by clicking a dark purple box in the upper-right corner of the start screen. These secrets add extra narrative depth for completionists. To access the password, community members suggest reading the game's script.rpy file in the game folder.

          <p class="text-slate-700 dark:text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
            The official itch.io page offers two versions of Lovemoney game. The OLD version is the original release, which contains bugs, unfinished features, and translation issues according to the developer's description. The UPDATE version is recommended for new players, as it includes additional mechanics, secret content including the 12 hidden notes and password screen, and a revised story. Both versions are available in English and Russian languages.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 text-slate-700 dark:text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
            File sizes differ between versions: the UPDATE version is approximately 315-334 MB depending on language and platform, while the OLD version is 193 MB. Unless you're specifically interested in experiencing the original buggy release or comparing how the game evolved, we recommend downloading the UPDATE version for the most complete experience.

            <p class="text-slate-700 dark:text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
              The official itch.io page confirms that Lovemoney uses mouse input exclusively. Click on Harvey to earn money, click on shop items to purchase upgrades, and click through dialogue boxes to advance the story. The interface is designed to be intuitive and requires no complex control schemes — everything you need to do can be accomplished with simple left-clicks.

              Some community guides mention that the Escape key can be used to save your game, and that the spacebar or Enter key might work for clicking in browser versions. However, these keyboard shortcuts are not mentioned on the official itch.io page, and we cannot independently verify that they work in the current release. If you want to ensure compatibility, stick with mouse controls as officially documented.

            <p class="text-slate-700 dark:text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
              Developer Buwu noted in the comments that the menu and settings text remains in Russian even in the English version because they wanted to hide the menu but couldn't implement that feature. If you see Russian text in your interface, you can take a screenshot and use a translation tool to understand the menu options. However, most players report that the game is short enough that they don't need to use the menu system frequently — you can typically complete a playthrough in one session without needing to save or adjust settings.

            Multiple players have reported that the UPDATE version of the game can change your Windows desktop wallpaper under certain conditions, specifically after achieving certain endings. The wallpaper may display disturbing imagery related to the game's story.

              According to developer Buwu, "The game is small and does not require saving." Most players complete a single playthrough in 30-60 minutes, making it easy to finish in one session. Some community guides mention that pressing Escape might save your game, but this has not been officially confirmed. If you want to explore different endings, plan to replay from the beginning each time.

You'll need approximately 327-334 MB of free storage space for the UPDATE version. A basic mouse is the only required input device.

The core gameplay loop appears to require active clicking throughout. If auto-clicking features exist, they may be part of specific shop upgrades that we haven't been able to independently verify.
